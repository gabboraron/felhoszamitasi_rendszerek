Usually, if you are asked by your employer not to work (assuming you're a full-time or part-time employee), you would be entitled to be paid.
However, that typically applies to natural disasters, and not a pandemic like COVID-19.
Experts say that, unless there's a special clause in your Enterprise Agreement, employers may be able to stand employees down without pay.
This will vary with each employer, so it's best to check with them.
For casual workers and independent contractors, including gig economy workers, the situation is potentially more grim.
According to Fair Work, if you're a casual employee needing to look after a family member who is sick with coronavirus, or suffering an unexpected emergency, you are entitled to just two days of unpaid carer's leave per occasion.
After that, you'll need to contact your employer to work out an arrangement.
Casual employees and independent contractors may qualify for the sickness allowance, a means-tested payment that provides up to $560 for singles without children and $1,010 for couples out of work due to illness.
The Government has waived the one-week waiting period to access the allowance.
The Federal Government has increased existing payments for welfare allowances, and expanding eligibility criteria for new applicants, for six months to late September.

The U.S. State Department has a Level 4 global health advisory in place, which says that Americans should avoid all international travel because of COVID-19.

""In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period,"" the advisory reads.

The situation is fluid and rapidly evolving, so you should check the State Department's website often and use that information to inform your decisions.

Many countries experiencing outbreaks are implementing travel restrictions, mandatory quarantines and border closures with little advanced notice, and some Americans traveling in those countries have found themselves stranded, without a way to get home. 

If you are in a high-risk group, meaning you are an older person, or have an underlying medical condition, ""you should now be thinking about social distancing,"" Schaffner advised.

""Part of that is thinking really hard about whether you need to get on an airplane,"" he said. ""I think this is a good time to postpone those trips.""

Even if your trip is to a low-risk area, traveling on a plane will mean being in an enclosed space with fellow travelers. The CDC now recommends that all travelers, especially those with underlying health conditions, avoid cruise ships."
ABC News,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/coronavirus-symptoms-questions-covid-19-answered/story?id=69768756,How is it transmitted?,"The first cases of COVID-19 were believed to be linked to a live-animal market in China, but the virus has since been spreading from person to person.

Person-to-person transmission is most likely between people in close contact, about 6 feet. When a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or could possibly be inhaled by those people.

While the virus can be transmitted by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with COVID-19, health experts don't currently believe that's primarily how it's transmitted.","A study of previous coronaviruses found human coronaviruses could theoretically last on surfaces at room temperature for up to nine days.

That length of time could depend on:

The type of surface, because viruses survive on shiny, hard surfaces longer than soft ones;
Whether it is exposed to sunlight, because UV radiation kills viruses; and
Temperature and humidity, because viruses last longer at lower temperatures and lower humidity."
ABC News,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/coronavirus-symptoms-questions-covid-19-answered/story?id=69768757,I live in the United States. What should I do?,"While specific guidelines vary from city to city, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised that Americans practice social distancing, and stay home, avoid mass gatherings and maintain 6 feet between themselves and others whenever possible. These efforts are intended to help ""flatten the curve,"" which means distributing the number of coronavirus cases over a longer period of time, to avoid overwhelming the health care system.

Americans should continue to uphold proper flu season hygiene. Wash your hands often, stay home if you're sick and cough or sneeze into your elbow rather than your hand.

If schools in your district have not yet closed, Dr. William Schaffner, medical director for the nonprofit National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, suggested sitting down and outlining a plan for how your family might handle schools and businesses closing. Does an older relative take prescription medication? Now might be a good time to stockpile at least two weeks' worth.

Call schools and ask if there are plans for remote schooling -- as some schools have done. Figure out a childcare plan in the event schools close, and ask about remote working options. Asking more questions now hopefully means asking fewer later.","Not unless you are the one who is sick.

The CDC doesn’t currently recommend any healthy person wear a mask and doctors warn fiddling with putting on and taking off a mask could backfire by exposing your hands to your face.

""Surgical masks fit rather loosely around the face and are not constructed, nor thick enough, to prevent infection,"" Schaffner said.

While they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. N-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and aren't easy to wear, meaning they're not a practical option for everyday use. As health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.

In recent weeks, N-95 masks have grown so scarce that the White House is asking Americans who have them, as well as construction companies, to donate them to hospitals, so that health care workers aren't forced to treat COVID-19 patients without a mask, which puts them at risk for contracting the virus themselves.

""The other thing a mask can do is give you a false sense of security, and that's not helpful,"" said Dr. Michael Merson, a visiting professor at NYU's School of Global Public Health and a professor at Duke University. Masks work better at preventing people who are coughing and sneezing from spreading respiratory droplets and infecting others, but ""those people who are sick should probably be at home anyway.""

","Yes, but kids rarely have severe symptoms.

Reports from China include children who have contracted COVID-19, but those children typically had very mild symptoms and the majority of cases were diagnosed in adults. Severe complications from coronavirus, like acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock, are rare among kids. Similar to adults, children with underlying health problems may be at increased risk risk for complications associated with COVID-19.
"
ABC News,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/coronavirus-symptoms-questions-covid-19-answered/story?id=69768759,Should I be tested for the virus?,"It's not completely up to you.

The CDC recently rolled out new guidance, allowing anyone to be tested for COVID-19 without restrictions, as long as their doctor approves. Testing is on the rise in the U.S., but experts say it is not yet enough.

If you have traveled to an area with local transmission or have been in close contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus, and develop symptoms, such as cough or fever, your health care provider can work with the local health department to determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19.

If you have symptoms, but no travel history to an outbreak area, you could go to a clinic and have a rapid test done to rule out more common viruses, such as influenza, Merson advised.

If you have mild symptoms and are worried that you might have COVID-19, call your doctor or local health department instead of going to a clinic or doctor's office without an appointment, to ensure you aren't potentially exposing others to the virus. If you have severe breathing problems, seek medical attention or call 911 immediately, recommends Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News’ chief medical correspondent.

You should let the person you speak with know that you have respiratory problems and need to be isolated and seen right away.","Concerned.

Stay on top of CDC updates and guidance, as well as from state and local health departments. Take the time to sit down and plan for what you'll do if local transmission of the virus occurs in your city.

Even the experts aren't completely sure what's going to happen.

""It's hard,"" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who described receiving a text message from his son asking whether he should stock up on canned goods.

""I would be inclined not to,"" Perlman said. ""We know from other cases that it actually tends to make things worse, because people stock up and then we don't have anything.""

COVID-19 appears to be more fatal than the flu, with some studies pegging COVID-19's fatality rate at around 3.4%, while the flu's fatality rate is less than 1%. Still, experts anticipate that COVID-19's mortality rate will fall when more people with mild symptoms are diagnosed with the virus. Typically, the sickest people tend to seek health care treatment first. Compared to past coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, however, most COVID-19 cases are mild.

""For most people, it's going to mean no disease or a mild illness,"" Merson said. Unfortunately, that mildness could also explain why COVID-19 is spreading more rapidly than highly fatal diseases do. HIV, for example, ""was very fatal, but hard to transmit,"" he added."

For the United States, community transmission in several cities and a growing number of cases that aren't able to be traced to travel or contact with individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 makes it probable that there will be extensive spread here.

""It's hard,"" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who described receiving a text message from his son asking whether he should stock up on canned goods.

""I would be inclined not to,"" Perlman said. ""We know from other cases that it actually tends to make things worse, because people stock up and then we don't have anything.""

COVID-19 appears to be more fatal than the flu, with some studies pegging COVID-19's fatality rate at around 3.4%, while the flu's fatality rate is less than 1%. Still, experts anticipate that COVID-19's mortality rate will fall when more people with mild symptoms are diagnosed with the virus. Typically, the sickest people tend to seek health care treatment first. Compared to past coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, however, most COVID-19 cases are mild.

""For most people, it's going to mean no disease or a mild illness,"" Merson said. Unfortunately, that mildness could also explain why COVID-19 is spreading more rapidly than highly fatal diseases do. HIV, for example, ""was very fatal, but hard to transmit,"" he added.","We don't know.

Because COVID-19 is a new virus, we don't know whether pregnant women are more susceptible than the general population.

The CDC doesn’t currently recommend any healthy person wear a mask and doctors warn fiddling with putting on and taking off a mask could backfire by exposing your hands to your face.

""Surgical masks fit rather loosely around the face and are not constructed, nor thick enough, to prevent infection,"" Schaffner said.

While they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. N-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and aren't easy to wear, meaning they're not a practical option for everyday use. As health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.

In recent weeks, N-95 masks have grown so scarce that the White House is asking Americans who have them, as well as construction companies, to donate them to hospitals, so that health care workers aren't forced to treat COVID-19 patients without a mask, which puts them at risk for contracting the virus themselves.

""The other thing a mask can do is give you a false sense of security, and that's not helpful,"" said Dr. Michael Merson, a visiting professor at NYU's School of Global Public Health and a professor at Duke University.

If you have severe breathing problems, seek medical attention or call 911 immediately, recommends Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News’ chief medical correspondent.

You should let the person you speak with know that you have respiratory problems and need to be isolated and seen right away.","We don't know.

Because COVID-19 is a new virus, we don't know whether pregnant women are more susceptible than the general population. Based on data from previous coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS, some experts believe that pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe illness and death, but that data is limited and far from conclusive.

For now, neither the CDC nor the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend any specific guidance for pregnant women beyond what they recommend to the general public."

The U.S. State Department has a Level 4 global health advisory in place, which says that Americans should avoid all international travel because of COVID-19.

""In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period,"" the advisory reads.

The situation is fluid and rapidly evolving, so you should check the State Department's website often and use that information to inform your decisions.

Many countries experiencing outbreaks are implementing travel restrictions, mandatory quarantines and border closures with little advanced notice, and some Americans traveling in those countries have found themselves stranded, without a way to get home. 

If you are in a high-risk group, meaning you are an older person, or have an underlying medical condition, ""you should now be thinking about social distancing,"" Schaffner advised.

""Part of that is thinking really hard about whether you need to get on an airplane,"" he said. ""I think this is a good time to postpone those trips.""

Even if your trip is to a low-risk area, traveling on a plane will mean being in an enclosed space with fellow travelers. The CDC now recommends that all travelers, especially those with underlying health conditions, avoid cruise ships.","The COVID-19 test can be ordered by a specialist coronavirus clinic, your local GP or a hospital emergency department.

The Federal Government has announced plans to create up to 100 coronavirus pop-up clinics across the country.

But these testing facilities vary state by state, so it's best to first be in touch with the coronavirus health information hotline on 1800 020 080 for advice.

Testing methods may include a blood test, a swab test inside your nose or in the back of your throat, or a sputum test, which examines a mix of saliva and mucus.

Remember, you may still need a GP referral before attending new clinics, so be sure to check first."

ABC News,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/coronavirus-symptoms-questions-covid-19-answered/story?id=69768762,Is the outbreak a pandemic?,"Yes.

The World Health organization defines a pandemic as ""the worldwide spread of a new disease,"" and on March 11, the WHO's director general announced that COVID-19 met those criteria.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, stressed that the designation doesn't mean that citizens should stop trying to contain the virus.

""Find, isolate, test and treat every case, and trace every contact,"" he said. ""Ready your hospitals. Protect and train your health care workers.""

For the United States, community transmission in several cities and a growing number of cases that aren't able to be traced to travel or contact with individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 makes it probable that there will be extensive spread here.

""A lot of us have been sitting back and watching this from a distant place,"" Schaffner noted, adding that the game has changed in recent days. He cautioned against ""running around like a chicken with its head cut off,"" and recommended thinking ahead. A large increase in cases in your community could mean school closures or other changes to your routine.

""Be prudent and be prepared to participate as much as you can in social distancing when that becomes the order of the day,"" he said. If health authorities advise against mass gatherings, for example, don't make a fuss.

""It shouldn't panic you,"" Schaffner said. ""But it should get your attention.""","Not unless you are the one who is sick.

The CDC doesn’t currently recommend any healthy person wear a mask and doctors warn fiddling with putting on and taking off a mask could backfire by exposing your hands to your face.

""Surgical masks fit rather loosely around the face and are not constructed, nor thick enough, to prevent infection,"" Schaffner said.

While they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. N-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and aren't easy to wear, meaning they're not a practical option for everyday use. As health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.

In recent weeks, N-95 masks have grown so scarce that the White House is asking Americans who have them, as well as construction companies, to donate them to hospitals, so that health care workers aren't forced to treat COVID-19 patients without a mask, which puts them at risk for contracting the virus themselves.

""The other thing a mask can do is give you a false sense of security, and that's not helpful,"" said Dr. Michael Merson, a visiting professor at NYU's School of Global Public Health and a professor at Duke University. Masks work better at preventing people who are coughing and sneezing from spreading respiratory droplets and infecting others, but ""those people who are sick should probably be at home anyway.""

COVID-19 appears to be more fatal than the flu, with some studies pegging COVID-19's fatality rate at around 3.4%, while the flu's fatality rate is less than 1%.

Typically, the sickest people tend to seek health care treatment first. Compared to past coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, however, most COVID-19 cases are mild.

""For most people, it's going to mean no disease or a mild illness,"" Merson said.

There is no evidence of Covid-19 being transmitted through food, and thorough cooking will kill the virus. The UK Food Standards Agency website has advice on food safety.
If you aren't displaying coronavirus symptoms, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you start baking.
If you are showing symptoms of the virus - or have been in contact with someone who has - then it's probably not a good idea to prepare food for somebody else.
That's because coronavirus spreads through small droplets - packed with the virus - expelled by a sufferer if they cough or sneeze. These can cause an infection if they are breathed in, or if someone touches a surface on which they have landed.
While the chance of contracting coronavirus through food delivery is low, it does exist.

A study published last month suggests the virus survives longest on plastic and stainless steel surfaces - up to two to three days - and can live for up to 24 hours on cardboard. However, over that time the virus is likely to become less powerful.

Some NHS trusts will allow only one birth partner to be in attendance, where previously they had allowed two. There were reports that others had banned partners' attendance altogether, before doing a U-turn on official advice.

Understandably, some pregnant women feel nervous about going into a hospital in case it increases their risk of catching the coronavirus.

Asthma UK recommends you keep taking your preventer inhaler daily as prescribed, to help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by coronavirus. You should also carry your reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up.","It's hard to not be able to see our friends and family in person, especially on special occasions, so sending a gift shows we are thinking of them.
There is no evidence of Covid-19 being transmitted through food, and thorough cooking will kill the virus. The UK Food Standards Agency website has advice on food safety.
If you aren't displaying coronavirus symptoms, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you start baking.
If you are showing symptoms of the virus - or have been in contact with someone who has - then it's probably not a good idea to prepare food for somebody else.
That's because coronavirus spreads through small droplets - packed with the virus - expelled by a sufferer if they cough or sneeze. These can cause an infection if they are breathed in, or if someone touches a surface on which they have landed.
While the chance of contracting coronavirus through food delivery is low, it does exist.
The tin or box the cake is placed in probably presents a higher risk than the cake itself, so your friend should rinse the packaging when she receives the cake.
If you're dropping the cake off yourself, you should maintain social distancing by ensuring you stay 2m (6ft) apart from each other."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51176409,Are young people who smoke weed or tobacco at more risk? - Eric,"Smokers are more likely to have certain serious complications from coronavirus than other people, Public Health England says.
It points to early studies in China that indicate smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease.
Smoking tobacco or illegal drugs damages the lungs and airways, causing a range of respiratory problems. The coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, placing smokers at greater risk.
There is also evidence it suppresses and harms the immune system, with smokers twice as likely to catch pneumonia as non-smokers.
Smokers are also likely to regularly touch their mouth, increasing their risk of infection.
Sharing cigarettes or spliffs with others also makes you susceptible to catching coronavirus, which can be transmitted through saliva and via surfaces.","There are currently no formal restrictions on moving house, although the government has strongly advised against it where possible.

Some NHS trusts will allow only one birth partner to be in attendance, where previously they had allowed two. There were reports that others had banned partners' attendance altogether, before doing a U-turn on official advice.

Understandably, some pregnant women feel nervous about going into a hospital in case it increases their risk of catching the coronavirus.

Maternity units are carrying out some consultations over the phone or via video link, but some in-person visits with the midwife are essential for the wellbeing of the mother and baby, the Royal College of Midwives says.

 So it’s critical to play it safe and not infect yourself and, in turn, others. The CDC suggests: 
 
 Giving the sick person their own room to stay in, if possible. Keep the door closed.
 Having only one person serve as the caretaker.
 Asking the sick person to wear a face mask, if they are able to. If the mask causes breathing difficulties, then the caretaker should wear a mask instead.","The novel coronavirus is dangerous for several reasons, even if the number of deaths haven’t matched that of the flu.
 The first US case of coronavirus was reported in January, and the first US death from coronavirus was reported in late February. By April 9, the US had more than 456,800 cases of coronavirus, and more than 16,000 people have died.
 Since this flu season started October 1, more than 24,000 Americans have died from the flu, according to CDC estimates. Nationwide, the flu has infected at least 39 million people between October and late March. 
 But here are key differences when comparing the flu vs. coronavirus: 
 
 The CDC estimates for the flu go back to October 2019. But the first US case of coronavirus didn’t emerge until several months later.
 Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu. Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. But with coronavirus, “it’s likely between 2 and 3” other people.
 Coronavirus infections have a “very high mortality rate – one in six – among people who are over 80 and people with underlying chronic disease,” epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El-Sayed said. 
 People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days, and some get no symptoms at all. But during that time, they’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly. 
 A vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots. But about half of Americans don’t get vaccinated, including most children who die from the flu."

So why are the “peaks” of hospitalizations and deaths still yet to come?,"“There is a delay because the way it goes, you have people who get exposed; they get infected; the number of new infections, hospitalizations, critical care and deaths (follow),” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
 “So even when you suppress or stabilize the number of new infections, it’s still going to take a while before you see a decrease in hospitalizations, a decrease in intensive care, and a decrease in deaths. And in fact, deaths are the last thing that lag. So you could be doing well (with mitigation measures) and still see the deaths go up.”","Ideally, you should limit your children’s potential exposures to coronavirus and work out the safest plan possible with your ex. 
 The problem: Most state and county family courts are closed, or open only for emergencies involving abuse or endangerment. So if parents wanted to formally modify pre-existing custody agreements, they can’t.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,Can high or low temperatures kill coronavirus?,"“Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods of time at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we don’t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point,” the CDC says. 
 “The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.”
 President Donald Trump suggested this coronavirus could subside by the warmer summer months, but scientists say it’s too early to tell. And the fact that coronavirus keeps spreading in the Southern Hemisphere during its summer months suggests this strain might not succumb to warmer temperatures. 
 “The short answer is that while we may expect modest declines in the contagiousness of (novel coronavirus) in warmer, wetter weather and perhaps with the closing of schools … it is not reasonable to expect these declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent,” wrote Dr. Marc Lipsitch, director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard’s T.H.

 Now, the CDC “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies).”
 But there are several important caveats and key points: 
 
 The public should NOT buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks. Those are desperately needed by health care workers who are in close contact with coronavirus patients every day. 
 Instead, make your own cloth mask — it’s easy, and you don’t have to sew. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams shows how to make face masks with just a T-shirt and rubber bands in this CDC video. You can also use a bandana and a coffee filter. 
 Don’t be fooled: The main benefit of wearing masks in public isn’t to protect you from getting sick. Rather, it’s to protect others from yourself if you’re sick or you’re an asymptomatic carrier. “This is more for people who might be infected and don’t know it, and to try and lower the likelihood that they will spread this to somebody else,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. The CDC agreed.
 You can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask. The virus can stay alive on surfaces for up to 3 days, and it’s easy to touch your face whenever you’re not wearing a mask. Also, people often adjust face masks frequently, leading to more touching of the face — a common way that coronavirus spreads.
 It’s important to wash your cloth mask after every use. Here’s how. 
 Wearing cloth masks is just “an additional, voluntary public health measure,” the CDC said. To protect yourself from getting coronavirus, it’s critical to stay 6 feet away from others, wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time, and stop touching your face.","States have received guidance from the CDC on how to keep voting locations clean.

I was getting warmer and warmer, and I was super fatigued. … I would start experiencing the worst headaches I’ve ever felt in my life. They were absolutely horrible.”
 Eventually, the teen had to be hospitalized. His mother said she worried he might “fall asleep and never wake up.” 
 Mitchell is now recovering, but still has a cough almost a month later. 
 “I just hope everybody’s responsible, because it’s nothing to joke about,” he said. “It’s a real problem, and I want everybody to make sure they’re following social distancing guidelines and the group limits.

 There are several reasons hospitals are on track to face dire shortages, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert and professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 
 “About 20 or 30 years ago, we decided that we would not over-hospitalize,” Schaffner said.
 Back then, hospitals often had empty hospital beds for new patients. But now, many hospitals are “absolutely full,” Schaffner said. “We have under-built hospital beds because they are very expensive.”
 Also, Americans have grown accustomed to “just-in-time” ordering. But that becomes a huge problem when international supply chains are disrupted by an outbreak. “We didn’t anticipate international turbulence influencing this,” Schaffner said.
 Now, some health care workers are making their own masks. They’ve also been told they can use bandanas or scarves as masks.","If you rely on public transportation, use caution. If you’re sick or live in an area where an outbreak has been reported, avoid it. 
 Mass transit could increase your risk of exposure to coronavirus. Luckily, transit systems are upping their cleaning regimens — notably the New York subway system. 
 Dr. Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York University’s School of Public Health, has some tips: When you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you’re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you’re commuting. 
 Again, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. 
 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It’s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car. 
 If you have a chronic illness, find alternative means of transportation — being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection."

 “When you eat any kind of food, whether it be hot or cold, that food is going to go straight down into your stomach, where there’s a high acidity, low-pH environment that will inactivate the virus,” she said.
 But it’s a good idea to disinfect the takeout containers, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus, and it’s easy to touch your face without realizing it.

 But there are important differences between the book and reality. The original version of the book called the strain the “Gorki-400,” in reference to a Russian locality, before it was later changed to the “Wuhan-400.” In the book, the virus was man-made, while scientists believe the novel coronavirus started in animals and jumped to humans.

 Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden warned that move “would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.”
 Problems with the testing Malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown. 
 In the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time. 
 Some test kits that were sent around the country were flawed — a move that put the US behind about “four to five weeks,” says Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare.","If you can, you should stay home from work when you’re sick, whether or not you have coronavirus.

individuals who had the virus and eventually tested negative for it and were
released, only to test positive for it again a short time later.

Scientists in those countries have speculated that testing errors could be to
blame, either for a false negative that said the patients were free of the
virus or for the positive result that signalled its reoccurrence.

Dr. Iris Gorfinkel, a family physician and medical researcher, said it’s
really too soon to know whether an individual can contract COVID-19 more than
once, and how quickly that can happen.

“We actually don’t know. We don’t know how long-lasting the immunity is to
it,” she told CTV’s Your Morning on March 16. “These viruses have the tendency
to morph and change.”

In fact, it’s still not even clear if people develop an immediate immunity to
COVID-19, as is typically the case with other virus strains, such as the flu.

“So just like any other virus, there’s the possibility that it could shift or
drift. Just minor changes could change it from a once mild infection to a more
severe infection,” she explained.","As physical distancing recommendations have evolved, it has become clear that
authorities do not want anyone to get close to anyone from outside their
household unless absolutely necessary.

""Physical distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce
the spread of illness during an outbreak,"" PHAC says on its website, which
recommends that all Canadians avoid ""non-essential"" gatherings.

Gorfinkel said people should aim to avoid all unnecessary contact with
individuals to prevent further spread in their communities.

problem,” she said. “They’re the source where the majority of cases are going
to come from.”"

once, it is possible to have more than one different virus at the same time.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch said it’s absolutely possible for someone to have COVID-19
and a strain of the flu or another virus simultaneously.

“We sound like broken records in the medical and scientific community, but for
the last two months we’ve been saying ‘We’ve got to prepare for this. We’ve
got to prepare for this. Optimize your health,’” he told CTV’s Your Morning on
March 20.

Bogoch said people should “optimize” their health by getting vaccinated for
everything that they are eligible to be vaccinated for, such as influenza or
bacterial pneumonias.

“It’s totally possible to have what’s called a co-infection and we know people
who have multiple infections at the same time can have a worse outcome,” he
said.

","There is a test that can detect the presence of COVID-19 in a patient, but
jammed health-care systems mean many Canadians may make it through the
pandemic without ever knowing if they had contracted the virus.

Canada does not have formal criteria for determining who should be tested,
meaning guidelines vary from province to province. Health-care workers are
generally advised to prioritize testing only those who are showing symptoms of
COVID-19, particularly if they are in hospitals, long-term care homes or other

the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). If symptoms are present, they can
easily be mistaken for a common cold or the flu because of their similarities.

According to the health agency, the main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever,
coughing, difficulty breathing, and pneumonia in both lungs. In severe cases,
the illness can even result in death.

The World Health Organization lists additional symptoms that have been
documented in some COVID-19 patients, including tiredness, aches and pains,
sore throat, diarrhea, nausea and runny nose.

Gorfinkel said clinicians can’t distinguish between the illnesses based on
symptoms alone. She said they can all present the same way, which is why the
patient’s travel history or history of exposure to the virus is so important
in determining whether someone might have COVID-19.

“We do not have the facilities or the tests to test absolutely everybody, so
that history of travel if you’re basically otherwise well, that’s a critical
part of it,” she explained.","While the SARS-CoV-2 virus can linger on surfaces from anywhere to a couple of

According to PHAC data, people in their 20s were responsible for 12 per cent
of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada as of March 30, and those aged 19 or
younger made up 4 per cent of the country's total caseload.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch said that everyone can be infected by the novel coronavirus
and there’s always a risk that some people will have a more severe infection.

However, he said older people and those with underlying medical conditions
still have a greater risk of a severe outcome than younger individuals.

“If we take a step back and look at the 30,000-foot view and look at who is
more likely to get a severe infection, it is overwhelmingly those over the age
of 60 and really, over the age of 80 years old,” he told CTV’s Your Morning on
March 20.

Bogoch said the most important metric to look at when studying data about
severe infections from this virus is death.

“If you get infected, you either live or you die, it sounds morbid, but I
think that’s an extremely important distinction to make and if we look at
death, it is overwhelmingly in those over 60 and disproportionately high in
those over the age of 80,” he said.","There is a test that can detect the presence of COVID-19 in a patient, but

PHAC says that anyone who has been in contact with a suspected, probably or
confirmed case of COVID-19 should self-isolate for 14 days, starting at the
time of contact.

This approach was taken by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who entered self-
isolation with his family after Sophie Gregoire Trudeau tested positive for

as much as possible. They should also not share personal items with them, such
as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices. The ill
person should have their own bathroom, if possible. If not, they should put
the toilet lid down every time before flushing.

Caregivers should wear a mask, disposable gloves, and eye protection when
they’re in close proximity to the patient and never reuse the mask or gloves.

after contact with the sick individual.

At such a rate, the number of infected individuals will overwhelm our hospital system, because we simply don't have enough hospital beds and respirators to treat them all. The United States doesn't even have enough protective equipment at present to protect its own health care workers. 

Doing the math, if one person is infected with the virus on Jan 1, with the number of people infected people doubling every 3 days, then by March 31, over 1 billion people will have become infected. With the world population being around 7.8 billion, it would only take until April 9 for all of us to be infected.

The CARES Act not only provides relief for small business owners through loans but also allows the self-employed, independent contractors and part-time workers to collect unemployment benefits.
That initially seemed like double dipping to me. But as a colleague in the Twitterverse pointed out, it could make sense if your unemployment is covering personal expenses while your EIDL and/or PPP is covering other operating expenses. For example, if you are a restaurant owner, you have to pay for a mortgage, paid leave and supply chain disruptions, while we all wait out stay-at-home orders. But you also have to buy groceries and pay your home utility bills. If you can only get a loan to cover business expenses, you may still need unemployment benefits to pay your personal expenses.
Keep in mind, the details for unemployment benefits — eligibility rules, benefit amounts, length of payments, etc. — vary from state to state. In Illinois, for instance, to maintain your eligibility for unemployment, you must be able to work, you have to be available to accept a job and you have to be looking for work. If the additional loan funds allow you to keep running your business, it may be hard to demonstrate that you’re out of work.

Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianthompson1/2020/04/01/frequently-asked-questions-on-the-cares-business-loans/#5668f99a5767,Can I get an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) and a Paycheck Protection Program Loan (PPP)?,"Yes, you can get both loans, but the key is to use the money to cover different expenses. Section 1102(a)(2)(G), the section outlining the PPP loans, explains the borrower requirements. It says the borrower has to certify that “the eligible recipient has not received amounts under this subsection for the same purpose and duplicative amounts.”
As a reminder, EIDLs can be used to cover:

Paid sick leave to employees unable to work due to the direct effect of COVID-19. Maintain payroll Increased costs due to supply chain disruption Rent or mortgage payments Repaying obligations that cannot be met due to revenue loss

PPP loan funds can be used to cover:

Payroll costs Group health care benefits during periods of paid, sick, medical, or family leave, and insurance premiums. Interest on a mortgage obligation Rent, under lease agreements in force before February 15, 2020 Utilities, for which service began before February 15, 2020 Interest on any debt incurred before February 15, 2020

So, if you’re getting an EIDL to cover payroll expenses, you can’t get a PPP to cover payroll for the length of the forgiveness period (eight weeks from when the loan is due). You would have to use the EIDL for different operating expenses or payroll for a different period. This will also go for other state or local assistance.
That being said, you don’t have to have both. If you’ve already gotten an EIDL for payroll purposes but just want the PPP loan, you can refinance the loan into a PPP. Any amount that was given to you as a grant under the EIDL will reduce the amount forgiven under PPP.","Flattening the curve refers to the rate at which people are getting infected. Without intervention, the number of individuals who contract Covid-19 rises exponentially, which means it doubles at a constant rate — in this case, every three days. At such a rate, the number of infected individuals will overwhelm our hospital system, because we simply don't have enough hospital beds and respirators to treat them all. The United States doesn't even have enough protective equipment at present to protect its own health care workers. 

Doing the math, if one person is infected with the virus on Jan 1, with the number of people infected people doubling every 3 days, then by March 31, over 1 billion people will have become infected.

Do I still have payroll?,"Many sole proprietors or independent contractors have wondered what counts as payroll, if they don’t have any employees.

In its most recent guidance, the SBA clarified that while income of sole proprietors and independent contractors count as payroll, payments to independent contractors do not count: “independent contractors have the ability to apply for a PPP loan on their own so they do not count for purposes of a borrower’s PPP loan calculation.”
Payroll also includes payment of compensation to employees for:

Salary, wages, commission (not to exceed $100,000) Cash tips or equivalent Vacation, parental, family, medical or sick leave Severance or separation pay and any retirement benefit Group health care benefit pay including insurance premiums State and local tax on the compensation of employees","Tests are limited and most state and local health authorities will tell you not to get tested, even if you have symptoms, unless:

Similarly, the $10,000 advance (which should be coming to those of you that applied on Monday pretty soon) is not required to be repaid, even if you’re denied additional funds.

In kids, the virus is most likely to affect your nose and throat.",The coronavirus that is keeping us all at home started off in animals and then jumped to humans. Scientists say that when it stops spreading in humans it won’t totally disappear. It will still probably be around in animals.

Can the virus return?","Doctors say it is unlikely that the coronavirus would make you sick twice, especially if your body does a good job fighting it the first time.","Yes. The virus can also affect your nose and throat, your blood, and maybe your stomach and intestines too. In kids, the virus is most likely to affect your nose and throat."
NDTV,https://www.ndtv.com/coronavirus/faq,What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. 


 
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:


 
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. 



Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. 



Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. 



Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. 



Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. 


 
Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. 


 
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.",Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.
NDTV,https://www.ndtv.com/coronavirus/faq,Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading,"Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for everyone)
Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses. 


If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.","The infection period for the virus will vary from person to person. Mild symptoms in an otherwise healthy individual may resolve over just a few days. Similar to influenza, for an individual with other ongoing health issues, such as a respiratory condition, recovery may take weeks and in severe cases could be potentially fatal."
NDTV,https://www.ndtv.com/coronavirus/faq,Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available.","Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.
Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water
Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).
Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).
Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.
After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.
Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.
Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water."
NDTV,https://www.ndtv.com/coronavirus/faq,What Is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.","While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
NDTV,https://www.ndtv.com/coronavirus/faq,How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go.","It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses.

NDTV,https://www.ndtv.com/coronavirus/faq,How Does COVID-19 Spread?,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.","The infection period for the virus will vary from person to person. Mild symptoms in an otherwise healthy individual may resolve over just a few days. Similar to influenza, for an individual with other ongoing health issues, such as a respiratory condition, recovery may take weeks and in severe cases could be potentially fatal."
NDTV,https://www.ndtv.com/coronavirus/faq,How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?,"The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available.","The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings."
NDTV,https://www.ndtv.com/coronavirus/faq,What Are The Symptoms Of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.

Well, we do have a preliminary snapshot of cases in the U.S. from the CDC. And the picture so far is similar to what was documented in China. Coronavirus hits oldest people - older people the hardest. The CDC analysis found that about half of the people who've ended up in intensive care are 65 and older; the highest percentage of deaths in the U.S. has been among those 85 and older. Now this is based on an analysis of about 500 patients admitted to the hospital in the U.S. - so not all of the cases. But here's something to be aware of - younger adults can be vulnerable too; about 20% of people hospitalized were in their 40s and 50s. And this may come as a surprise - about 20% were younger. So some millennials and Gen Xers have gotten seriously ill.","With new research that suggests the new coronavirus can live on surfaces for hours or days, the prospect of going grocery shopping can seem daunting.
But you can manage the risk.
First of all, the viability of the virus goes down over time and it's sensitive to temperature – so it dies off more quickly in room temperature than it does in the cold.
Second, when you go to a grocery store, people aren't generally touching all the cans on the shelf — although there tends to be more handling of individual items in the produce section.
Among the things you can do to protect yourself and others are:
Ko says it helps to understand the differing levels of risk in different situations. Coming into close contact with a person who is infected with coronavirus carries greater risk than touching a shopping cart that might have been touched by an infected person hours or days earlier.
When it comes to disinfecting things, it makes sense to focus on high-touch surfaces. Ko says you should worry more about disinfecting bathroom doorknobs and faucets at home than about a can of tomato soup from the supermarket.
""There's never anything that has zero risk,"" Ko says, ""but the risk is so much lower than [surfaces] that are more frequently touched."""

But it's worth noting - an analysis from Italy shows that about 99% of the people who've died in Italy from the virus had at least one underlying illness or condition such as heart disease, a history of stroke, diabetes. So these certainly seem to increase the risk of death or serious illness.","Masks can also function as an important visual cue, says Joseph Allen, an assistant professor of exposure and assessment science at Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
They're a ""reminder that we need to be taking these precautions and serve as a reminder to people to keep that 6-foot buffer,"" he says. ""It should be seen as a badge of honor.

I want to do my part in limiting how I might impact you.""
Klompas agrees — and says that it can also give the wearer a welcome sense of security.
""It feels like you're behind a shield,"" he says, ""and I think that in itself can be reassuring.""
And for the others around you, it's a warning. ""It says: Watch out. There's a public health crisis right now, there's a virus going around, we need to be on top guard,"" says Klompas. ""I think it can actually be a reinforcer, a reminder of the state of crisis that we face in society.""
But he says that masks are not a replacement for all the other steps we need to take right now to protect ourselves from the coronavirus — especially social distancing and good hand hygiene."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/23/820009363/we-answer-your-coronavirus-questions,"Well, let's talk about treatments for people who would end up in the hospital with COVID-19. The president and Dr. Anthony Fauci had a kind of debate in a briefing last week about how near some kind of treatment drug might be. What is the latest here? What's actually available?","That's right. Well, the Milken Institute is tracking the development of a whole bunch of potential treatments and vaccines. They've identified literally dozens of different candidates in the works on both the vaccine side, the treatment side - over 40 different compounds being looked at for the vaccine. But a vaccine is definitely a ways off. I mean, 12 to 18 months is an optimistic estimate out there.

In regard to treatments, there are clinical trials underway to look at the safety, efficacy of different drugs, from antivirals to antibody treatments. With one candidate, an antiviral called Remdesivir, some early results are expected later this spring, and there's a lot of hope out there. But obviously it's important to see what the studies find.","There is little data so far on cloth or homemade masks in general — let alone data that dictates how many pleats to put on your home-sewn version.
Griffin says the best material to use is a tight-weave cotton. ""Don't use a synthetic or a polyester because they've looked at the virus's ability to survive on surfaces, and spandex is the worst,"" he says.
Johns Hopkins Medicine has one design you might try. Kaiser Permanente has another design, as well as a video showing how to make a mask using a sewing machine. Both recommend 100% woven cotton fabric. Kaiser recommends washing and drying the fabric two or three times before cutting it, so it doesn't shrink later.
You can make a mask out of a T-shirt, no sewing machine required. You could also try making one out of (unused) shop towels. But no matter what you make it out of, try to make it fit closely to your face and don't touch the front of it once you've started wearing it."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/23/820009363/we-answer-your-coronavirus-questions,What about simply testing people to see if they have the virus?,"Well, we know it's been a very bumpy start - right? - lots of stories of delays, backlogs, despite promises to expand quickly. Now, over the weekend, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for a new diagnostic tool. This can provide results within hours rather than days. The company says it's going to make this available - roll this out by March 30th, so end of next week. So this could speed up testing.","After you get a handle on making masks, you could keep going – and donate the additional masks to health care centers. Johns Hopkins University, for instance, is accepting donated masks for nonpatient care settings. It asks that masks not be made in a solid color, especially blue or white, which could be confused with medical-grade masks."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/23/820009363/we-answer-your-coronavirus-questions,So how can I tell the difference between someone who just has allergies and somebody who has something worse?,"So there is some overlap. But there are key differences, too. I've spoken to a bunch of allergists about this. And here is one very important distinction - fever is a symptom of COVID-19, but it is not a symptom of seasonal allergies. With all of that pollen starting to develop around the country, a lot of people are sneezing and will have a runny nose. These are typical symptoms of seasonal allergies but not necessarily typical of coronavirus. Cough is another very important distinction. Coughing is usually not a main symptom of seasonal allergies, but it is a key symptom of COVID-19, especially a dry cough.","Well, that's important to understand, and we don't have a complete picture yet of which underlying medical problems were present in how many of these younger people. But it's worth noting - an analysis from Italy shows that about 99% of the people who've died in Italy from the virus had at least one underlying illness or condition such as heart disease, a history of stroke, diabetes. So these certainly seem to increase the risk of death or serious illness."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/23/820009363/we-answer-your-coronavirus-questions,"People are also asking about re-infection, whether you are immune to this once you've had it.","Well, with a lot of viruses, I mean, after you've gotten exposed to it the first time, you'll have partial protection against it going forward. And there is reason to think that the same could be true with this virus. Now, the CDC says there's still a lot that is not known about the immune response to COVID-19. But for now, they're saying patients who have recovered from an infection are not likely to be re-infected shortly afterwards.","It probably can — but you shouldn't be overly worried. Here's why.
So far, there aren't scientific findings on how long the virus can live on fabric. But fabrics are generally porous — as is cardboard, which has been tested. And a recent study did find that the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours.
""The thing that you have to consider, though, is that those tests are done in ideal testing circumstances,"" says Rachel Graham, a virologist at the University of North Carolina. ""That's like in some kind of hermetically sealed box where there's no fluctuation in humidity, there's no wind, there's nothing that can contribute toward desiccating the virus. And so desiccation — or drying out the virus — would actually reduce the amount of time it's actually viable on any kind of surface.""
Plus, porousness is a good thing when it comes to avoiding viral transmission. A surface that is permeable, like a fabric, tends to trap viruses more easily than hard surfaces.
""It's less at risk of transmitting because the virus gets kind of stuck to the [porous] surface, and so it can't be easily transferred back off of it,"" Graham says. ""Porous surfaces also suck the fluid out of it. The viral membrane is a lipid membrane, and so if that becomes dried out, it's basically done, infectivity-wise.""
If you are concerned that clothing or other fabric items might have picked up the virus, throw the clothing in the washer and dryer. For most situations, says Graham, your detergent will do its job and get rid of any infective particles — or at least sanitize them to the point where they're not a risk to you.
If you're taking care of someone who is ill or immunocompromised or if you're working in a health care setting, you may want to take additional precautions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommendations for households with suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus, which include wearing gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and using the warmest appropriate water setting when washing clothes or linens to disinfect them.
I like to use wipes to disinfect surfaces in my home — especially surfaces that are frequently touched. But how much surface area can one wipe be used on before it loses its ability to kill the coronavirus?
The first step is to check the label on the wipes you're using. For instance, the label on a container of Clorox wipes instructs: ""Use enough wipes for treated surface to remain visibly wet for 4 minutes. To kill viruses, let stand 15 seconds.""
That time and that visible wetness are important, says Erica Hartmann, an expert in environmental microbiology at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering.
Regardless of the particular ingredients in the wipes you're using, ""they're all chemicals that have to react,"" she says. ""And those chemical reactions aren't instantaneous — they take a certain amount of time. So what you're doing when you're keeping the surface wet is you're basically allowing time, allowing the chemical reactions to take place.""
So if that Clorox wipe isn't making the surface visibly wet for 4 minutes, you're trying to cover too much ground with one wipe.
There's no exact figure for how much surface area a wipe can handle. But a 2018 study found that one wipe is generally more effective over 1 to 2 square feet than 8 square feet.
And you don't need a premade wipe to clean surfaces: You can also use a liquid product on a cloth or paper towel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises using products that contain bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or alcohol (at least 70%) and following the manufacturer's directions. You can make your own cleaning solution by mixing 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water, according to the CDC.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has posted a list of approved products to disinfect against the coronavirus.
Strangers keep petting my dog when we go for a walk. Could my dog transmit the virus on its fur?
Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist at the health care system HonorHealth, says she's not especially concerned about dog fur transmitting the virus. ""I think that I would probably be more worried if somebody was coughing all over the place and went to touch my dog's harness or something — something inanimate,"" she says. ""I would put it in the lower-risk category.""
That's because like fabric, fur is a porous surface — so it isn't easy for a person to pick up bits of virus from it. ""The chances of you getting it from fur and hair is going to be less than getting it from a solid surface,"" says Graham, the virologist. Still, she said, she would err on the side of caution and ask people not to pet your dog right now.
Graham says one way to make sure your dog doesn't get touched by overenthusiastic petters is to avoid letting your dog off leash in a place where it may encounter other people. Rather than going to a dog park, she says, ""it might be a better idea to take your dog out in the yard or somewhere you know that there's not going to be a lot of people.""
And despite the occasional media report of a dog diagnosed with COVID-19, there is no evidence that pets can contract or spread COVID-19. The CDC says it has not received any reports of pets or animals becoming sick with the disease. The American Veterinary Medical Association concurs: ""Infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets become ill with COVID-19 or that they spread it to other animals, including people.""
One note: If you are already sick with COVID-19, the association recommends limiting contact with animals ""out of an abundance of caution"" until more is known about the virus. If you're not sick with the coronavirus, the group says you can interact with your pet as you normally would — while practicing good hygiene, including washing your hands before and after interacting with your pet."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/23/820009363/we-answer-your-coronavirus-questions,So when might things begin to get back to normal?,"Oh, gosh. Well, you know, we're halfway through that 15-day period announced last week asking everyone to hunker down, stay home. And what Anthony Fauci, the top adviser, has said over the weekend is that the social distancing, all the measures we're taking - they will have an effect. But we just can't quantify the effect yet. I mean, how much we may be slowing the spread here is masked by the significant increase in cases each day, as you just mentioned at the top.

So you know, as testing expands, we're going to get this increase in cases. Hard to see the progress here - it's likely going to be much, much longer before life feels like normal again, right? I mean, many schools have extended closures. There'll be lots of distance learning going on. Many scientists and public health experts watching China as the country lifts its restrictions. Does the virus stay under control, or does it start to spread again? We can learn a lot by watching what happens there.","Last week, the U.K. government signaled that it might be considering a different approach to coronavirus control than the rest of the world — in essence, allowing a large percentage of the population to become infected in order to develop a ""herd immunity"" that would eventually end the epidemic.
Herd immunity occurs when enough people in a population are immune to disease — either because they've been infected and recovered or they've been vaccinated against it. The idea is that the pool of people who can catch the disease has been reduced, reducing the risk to the so-far unaffected.
Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government's chief scientific adviser, said that about 60% of the population would need to get the coronavirus in order to get a herd immunity effect.
But using such an approach would raise a big question: During that spread, how do you protect the most vulnerable groups – the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions?
Herd immunity works with contagious diseases like measles, for which a vaccine exists. But the idea that the U.K. would not immediately work to suppress the number of cases, especially as there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 yet and the disease has killed thousands in Italy, stirred an immediate public backlash.
The government quickly backtracked, and on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all restaurants, pubs and gyms would close for the foreseeable future to reduce transmission.
And there is no certainty that herd immunity would even work for coronavirus. That approach ""assumes that people being infected are immune and cannot get re-infected. And we don't know that as of yet,"" says Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health.
People who go outside to exercise are sometimes shamed on TV and on social media for risky behavior. Is it okay to go outside for a walk, run or bike ride?
The White House coronavirus guidelines for the 15-day period that started Monday advise avoiding ""discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits,"" as well as ""social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people."" But outdoor exercise is not on the list.
So unless local guidelines instruct otherwise, fresh air and outdoor exercise are allowed – though it's important to keep some distance between yourself and others. The coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through close contact between people – within about six feet.
The primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets.
There is better airflow outside than in confined spaces. That air flow outside reduces the risk of one person transmitting the virus to another through droplets in the air, says Albert Ko, the Yale epidemiologist. ""So if you're going out and you're hiking or biking or running and you're not within, say, six feet or 10 feet of another person, I would consider that a healthy, safe practice.""
Ko also points to the significant mental health issues that can be caused or exacerbated when people are cooped up.
""My personal feeling is that if people are practicing sound respiratory hygiene, sound hand hygiene, they're distancing themselves physically from others outside, and you're exercising and walking in the park — I think that's actually a good public health practice."""

It's not yet clear whether people can be reinfected by this coronavirus or how long immunity might last after infection.
Immunity after recovery from COVID-19 would be a boon in the global fight to rein in the virus. People who have recovered and gained immunity would be especially valuable as health care workers. The spread of the virus would slow if more people had immunity to it. And antibodies from recovered people could help in developing a treatment for the disease.
As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has reported, scientists are looking for clues about immunity to and reinfection from other coronaviruses.
The severe coronaviruses SARS and MERS did produce antibodies in those who had the virus. In the case of MERS, survivors generated an immune response to the virus that could be detected up to two years later. And the sicker the patient was, the more long lasting their immune response.
But in the case of the four seasonal coronaviruses that are a cause of the common cold, they can sicken people over and over again. After infection with one of these viruses, antibodies are produced — but then the levels slowly decline and people become susceptible again.
There are some indications that the new coronavirus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, can spur immunity. New not-yet-peer-reviewed research in rhesus macaques found that the new coronavirus does not cause reinfections.
""I think there's a very likely scenario where the virus comes through this year, and everyone gets some level of immunity to it, and if it comes back again, we will be protected from it,"" Matt Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, told NPR.

Is that true?,"The World Health Organization and many infectious disease experts say that there is no good scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen and worsening of COVID‑19.
The notion that such a link exists was sparked last weekend when a tweet by the French health minister warned people not to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — a category of pain relievers and fever reducers that includes ibuprofen — because, he said, some French COVID-19 patients had experienced serious side effects. The warning was also included in a bulletin from the French health ministry, which counseled that patients should instead use acetaminophen, the generic name for Tylenol.
But experts say that warning isn't based on data.
""Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen,"" the WHO stated on its official Twitter account, adding, ""'We are also consulting with physicians treating COVID-19 patients and are not aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known side effects that limit its use in certain populations.""
Dr. Angela Rogers, a pulmonologist at the Stanford University Medical Center and chair of its intensive care unit's COVID-19 task force, notes that Tylenol is the go-to medication for patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized for any infection. That's because these patients are at higher risk of damage to internal organs, including kidneys. And kidney damage can be a side effect of ibuprofen for some patients who use it long-term in higher doses, says Rogers, whose research focuses on the kind of acute respiratory distress experienced by the most severe COVID-19 cases.
Tylenol, like any medicine, isn't risk-free either; Rogers notes that acetaminophen can cause serious liver damage in high doses. In low doses, though, she says, Tylenol is ""very effective"" for reducing fever and ""very safe.""","That's right. Well, the Milken Institute is tracking the development of a whole bunch of potential treatments and vaccines.

First of all, the viability of the virus goes down over time and it's sensitive to temperature – so it dies off more quickly in room temperature than it does in the cold.
Second, when you go to a grocery store, people aren't generally touching all the cans on the shelf — although there tends to be more handling of individual items in the produce section.
Among the things you can do to protect yourself and others are:
Ko says it helps to understand the differing levels of risk in different situations. Coming into close contact with a person who is infected with coronavirus carries greater risk than touching a shopping cart that might have been touched by an infected person hours or days earlier.
When it comes to disinfecting things, it makes sense to focus on high-touch surfaces. Ko says you should worry more about disinfecting bathroom doorknobs and faucets at home than about a can of tomato soup from the supermarket.
""There's never anything that has zero risk,"" Ko says, ""but the risk is so much lower than [surfaces] that are more frequently touched.""","Yes. But only if you use the mask properly and don't touch it with your hands afterward.
Those droplets from a cough or sneeze would hit your mask instead of your mouth and nose — good news. But the next step is to take the mask off by the ear bands and either wash or discard it — without touching the front of it.
""That's what I see all the time,"" says Griffin. ""That's why in the studies, masks fail — people don't use them [correctly]. They touch the front of it. They adjust it. They push it down somehow to get their nose stuck out.""
If you touch the front of the mask, whatever that person coughed or sneezed on it is now on your hands.
As this video from the World Health Organization shows, you should take off your mask by removing the elastics or straps from behind your ears. Don't touch the front, and keep the mask away from your face.
One other thing: Ideally you would have eye protection, too, to keep that stranger's sneeze from getting in. Glasses and sunglasses aren't perfect but can help."

While there is still much to be learned about the novel coronavirus, it appears that many people who are infected are shedding the virus – through coughs, sneezes and other respiratory droplets – for 48 hours before they start feeling sick. And others who have the virus – up to 25%, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield — may never feel symptoms but may still play a role in transmitting it.
That's why wearing a mask even if you don't feel sick can be a good idea.
If you cough or sneeze, the mask can catch those respiratory droplets so they don't land on other people or surfaces. ""So it's not going to protect you, but it is going to protect your neighbor,"" says Dr. Daniel Griffin at Columbia University, an expert on infectious diseases. ""If your neighbor is wearing a mask and the same thing happens, they're going to protect you. So masks worn properly have the potential to benefit people.""
The best masks are N95 respirators, but the general public is urged not to use them because they are fiercely needed by health care workers right now. If you have those, consider donating them immediately to a local hospital or find a drop-off here. Same goes for surgical masks — those thin blue models-- which offer less protection but are helpful and are also in short supply.","As NPR has previously reported, some research has shown that cotton T-shirt material and tea towels might help block respiratory droplets emitting from sick people — though it's not clear how much protection they provide.
Another study, of health care workers in Vietnam, found that use of cloth masks resulted in greater infection than either those wearing surgical masks or a control group, some of whom also wore surgical masks.
We don't yet know exactly how effective homemade masks are, but Griffin thinks they're a good idea — he has even taken to wearing one over his N95 respirator."

Well, we do have a preliminary snapshot of cases in the U.S. from the CDC. And the picture so far is similar to what was documented in China. Coronavirus hits oldest people - older people the hardest. The CDC analysis found that about half of the people who've ended up in intensive care are 65 and older; the highest percentage of deaths in the U.S. has been among those 85 and older. Now this is based on an analysis of about 500 patients admitted to the hospital in the U.S. - so not all of the cases. But here's something to be aware of - younger adults can be vulnerable too; about 20% of people hospitalized were in their 40s and 50s. And this may come as a surprise - about 20% were younger. So some millennials and Gen Xers have gotten seriously ill."

Now, over the weekend, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for a new diagnostic tool. This can provide results within hours rather than days. The company says it's going to make this available - roll this out by March 30th, so end of next week. So this could speed up testing."

""You don't take this dirty mask off, put it in your purse and then stick it back on your face,"" he says. ""It's something that once you put on, is potentially either touching your coughs, sneezes or the spray of your speech, or protecting you from the coughs, spray, speech of other people. And now it's dirty. It needs to basically be either discarded or washed.""
So if you're wearing a cloth mask, put it into the laundry basket immediately. If it's disposable, throw it away.
It's a big no-no to pull the mask down to eat a snack, then pull it back up: You've just gotten whatever dirty stuff is on the mask on your hands and into your mouth.","Last week, the U.K. government signaled that it might be considering a different approach to coronavirus control than the rest of the world — in essence, allowing a large percentage of the population to become infected in order to develop a ""herd immunity"" that would eventually end the epidemic.
Herd immunity occurs when enough people in a population are immune to disease — either because they've been infected and recovered or they've been vaccinated against it. The idea is that the pool of people who can catch the disease has been reduced, reducing the risk to the so-far unaffected.
Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government's chief scientific adviser, said that about 60% of the population would need to get the coronavirus in order to get a herd immunity effect.
But using such an approach would raise a big question: During that spread, how do you protect the most vulnerable groups – the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions?
Herd immunity works with contagious diseases like measles, for which a vaccine exists. But the idea that the U.K. would not immediately work to suppress the number of cases, especially as there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 yet and the disease has killed thousands in Italy, stirred an immediate public backlash.
The government quickly backtracked, and on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all restaurants, pubs and gyms would close for the foreseeable future to reduce transmission.
And there is no certainty that herd immunity would even work for coronavirus. That approach ""assumes that people being infected are immune and cannot get re-infected. And we don't know that as of yet,"" says Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health.
People who go outside to exercise are sometimes shamed on TV and on social media for risky behavior. Is it okay to go outside for a walk, run or bike ride?
The White House coronavirus guidelines for the 15-day period that started Monday advise avoiding ""discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits,"" as well as ""social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people."" But outdoor exercise is not on the list.
So unless local guidelines instruct otherwise, fresh air and outdoor exercise are allowed – though it's important to keep some distance between yourself and others. The coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through close contact between people – within about six feet.
The primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets.
There is better airflow outside than in confined spaces. That air flow outside reduces the risk of one person transmitting the virus to another through droplets in the air, says Albert Ko, the Yale epidemiologist. ""So if you're going out and you're hiking or biking or running and you're not within, say, six feet or 10 feet of another person, I would consider that a healthy, safe practice.""
Ko also points to the significant mental health issues that can be caused or exacerbated when people are cooped up.
""My personal feeling is that if people are practicing sound respiratory hygiene, sound hand hygiene, they're distancing themselves physically from others outside, and you're exercising and walking in the park — I think that's actually a good public health practice."""

Griffin says the best material to use is a tight-weave cotton. ""Don't use a synthetic or a polyester because they've looked at the virus's ability to survive on surfaces, and spandex is the worst,"" he says.
Johns Hopkins Medicine has one design you might try. Kaiser Permanente has another design, as well as a video showing how to make a mask using a sewing machine. Both recommend 100% woven cotton fabric. Kaiser recommends washing and drying the fabric two or three times before cutting it, so it doesn't shrink later.
You can make a mask out of a T-shirt, no sewing machine required. You could also try making one out of (unused) shop towels. But no matter what you make it out of, try to make it fit closely to your face and don't touch the front of it once you've started wearing it.","Oh, gosh. Well, you know, we're halfway through that 15-day period announced last week asking everyone to hunker down, stay home. And what Anthony Fauci, the top adviser, has said over the weekend is that the social distancing, all the measures we're taking - they will have an effect. But we just can't quantify the effect yet. I mean, how much we may be slowing the spread here is masked by the significant increase in cases each day, as you just mentioned at the top.

So you know, as testing expands, we're going to get this increase in cases. Hard to see the progress here - it's likely going to be much, much longer before life feels like normal again, right? I mean, many schools have extended closures. There'll be lots of distance learning going on. Many scientists and public health experts watching China as the country lifts its restrictions. Does the virus stay under control, or does it start to spread again? We can learn a lot by watching what happens there."

""You can imagine if you put a loosely knit scarf with lots of holes in it ... that would not be very effective,"" says Dr. Michael Klompas, an infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
The goal is to create a barrier that catches droplets and keeps others from coming in, so you want coverage that is tightly woven and close-fitting.","Yes. But only if you use the mask properly and don't touch it with your hands afterward.

Klompas agrees — and says that it can also give the wearer a welcome sense of security.
""It feels like you're behind a shield,"" he says, ""and I think that in itself can be reassuring.""
And for the others around you, it's a warning. ""It says: Watch out. There's a public health crisis right now, there's a virus going around, we need to be on top guard,"" says Klompas. ""I think it can actually be a reinforcer, a reminder of the state of crisis that we face in society.""

A number of large internet companies have agreed not to terminate residential or small-business customers who can’t pay their bills. Exact policies and requirements vary, though, so if you need help, you should call and ask.  **Housing** There’s also a good chance you can delay your mortgage payment if the outbreak has left you short of money.

The quickest way to assess immunity to the coronavirus is a test that looks for protective antibodies in the blood of people who have recovered. But first you have to have the test.  Labs around the world are working on such tests, but none are readily accessible quite yet.","Probably not. You'd have to stay about six feet away from your friend.

Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.  The New York Times and other news outlets had been reporting the C.D.C.’s previous guidance.

It says do not shake dirty laundry, to minimize the possibility of dispersing the virus through the air. If possible, wash items using the warmest water setting, and dry thoroughly. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill person can be washed with other people’s items, the C.D.C. said.  Clean and disinfect hampers or other carts for transporting laundry, according to the guidelines for cleaning surfaces.  The need for physical distancing has prompted some laundromats to dismantle their seating areas, according to Planet Laundry, the magazine of the Coin Laundry Association. Some laundromats are asking people to stay in their cars during their wash and dry cycles, and some have removed chairs and tables to discourage people from mingling.  Commercial-grade washers and dryers operate at higher temperatures and with more rigorous mechanical action that, when combined with hot water and proper detergent use, can effectively flush contaminants from clothing better than residential machines, says the association, which represents 30,000 small businesses."

Recognize your own agency and start taking care of the common-sense precautionary measures that are within your control, like stocking up on a [couple of extra weeks’ supply](https://www.ready.gov/pandemic) of food or medication.  Maintaining social connection, despite physical distance, is also important. Reach out to others via phone calls, emails or video chats, and talk through the feelings you’re experiencing. It’s important to be gentle with yourself, and maintain any kind of routine you can to have a sense of stability.

But don’t forget about cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily; that includes the interior of your vehicle, like the steering wheel. And when doing laundry, use the warmest appropriate setting and dry items fully.","Authorities in different states have used different phrases while asking people to stay home.  Generally, it means you should limit trips outside except for essential needs. You can still go for walks and exercise, but do it in a way that keeps you several feet away from other people.

For [older Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/emergency/pdf/SIP-pan-flu- injects.pdf) and those with health problems who are most at risk if they contract the coronavirus, having goods delivered makes sense.

Those services have a large network in place, though, which means their businesses are likely to thrive. Smaller retailers will not as Americans eschew restaurants, bars and specialty stores. That is why some restaurants are promoting delivery services as a way to stay in business, and why some cities that have ordered restaurants and bars to close have made exceptions for places providing delivery and takeout.  But what about delivery workers? Some groups, like Gig Workers Rising, are demanding that employers like Doordash and Instacart do more to protect them on the job. Recently, the group started [a petition](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/demand-gig-economy-companies- give-paid-sick-time-off-during-coronavirus) asking companies to provide paid time off to drivers who become sick during the coronavirus outbreak and cannot work.  The bottom line is this: Online deliveries are a boon for those who cannot leave their homes, as well as small restaurants who fear going out of business. But at the same time it comes with a risk to drivers and delivery workers who fear the loss of income if they get sick. At a minimum, everyone should generously tip their drivers for the service.","Yes!

Working out, whether that means taking a socially distant walk or doing an at- home routine, can also help tire you out and dispel extra nervous energy.

South Korea did not lock down cities in the same way, but was extremely fast to test people, trace their contacts and quarantine infected people. And although China and South Korea have demonstrated that, with drastic actions, the virus can be brought under control, there is no guarantee it won’t resurge as their economies restart.  The U.S. has taken a much more piecemeal approach to confronting the virus.

Singapore, which has focused on early diagnosis, isolation and contact tracing, has also seen its rate of new cases drop.  In China, new reported infections were cut to just 24 in a recent headcount [from more than 3,500 a day](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/health/coronavirus-pandemic-who.html) in late January.

The program is aimed to help freelancers, part-time workers, furloughed employees and gig workers, such as Uber drivers, as well as full-time employees who have lost their jobs.  States have set their own rules for eligibility and benefits, which are generally calculated as a percentage of your income over the past year, up to a certain maximum. Some states are more generous than others, but unemployment typically replaces about 45 percent of your lost income. Under the plan, eligible workers would get an extra $600 per week on top of their state benefit.  One important note: You might not have to lose your job to qualify. If you’re quarantined or have been furloughed — and you’re not being paid but expect to return to your job eventually — you may be able to get unemployment benefits."

During the Cold War and after Sept. 11, 2001, the government devised emergency plans to protect government officials, like a nuclear bunker for Congress in West Virginia, now a tourist attraction. Those plans relied on the ability to gather lawmakers in a safe place together, however — a hazard during a pandemic.  ""There's no serious effort to grapple with what could happen in the event of a major catastrophe,"" said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who pushed for plans in the wake of Sept. 11.

So far, congressional leaders have [resisted calls for remote voting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/coronavirus-congress- voting.html), calling it a bad precedent and saying they need to address the current crisis. They have instead looked for ways to practice social distancing within the Capitol. ""There's reason to be wary about a virtual Congress,"" Mr. Ornstein said, like ensuring cybersecurity and that Americans can still see and hear lawmakers at work.  But he added that House and Senate leaders, through legislation or rule changes, could create the capacity for remote voting only in the most extreme circumstances, such as when many members are incapacitated or transportation to the Capitol or an alternate meeting place becomes impossible.","Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that infect animals and people.

Some experts believe the virus may also be airborne, but the wider consensus is that it’s droplet-spread.

Increasingly, those agencies also have fact-checking sections on their websites, aimed at combating misinformation. One of the most troubling rumors that often spreads alongside outbreaks is who exactly has the disease — something that can lead to racial and ethnic profiling.
Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said it is important to separate the disease from the person suffering from the disease. No ethnic group is more or less susceptible to the coronavirus.

Under a microscope, they look like a crown, or a halo — like the sun’s corona.
The current coronavirus first emerged from Wuhan, in China’s Hubei Province, most likely from a fish and animal market where humans routinely come into direct contact with animals. The virus probably jumped from an animal — we still don’t know for sure what species — to a human, a process of interspecies transmission called zoonosis.

The Hill,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/public-global-health/484770-what-to-know-about-the-coronavirus,How many people are infected?,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported at least 81,191 cases of the virus as of Wednesday morning. The vast majority of those cases, 78,064, are in mainland China, and most of those are in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak.
But officials are increasingly worried about South Korea, where the number of cases has climbed from just a handful to more than 1,200 in the last week or so. An outbreak in Italy has infected 322 people, a worrying sign that the virus may be gaining a foothold in Europe. Seven other European nations confirmed new cases of the virus overnight. And an outbreak in Iran has infected more than 100 residents.
“The sudden increases in cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.
The Iranian outbreak has spawned new cases in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman; the Italian outbreak is now linked to cases in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.
Tuesday marked a sobering moment for epidemiologists watching the virus: It was the first day that more new cases were confirmed in countries besides China than new cases in China itself, according to the WHO.
There have been 57 cases diagnosed in the United States, 36 of whom were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Most of the rest of the cases have occurred in travelers who have recently returned from China. Just two people have been infected in the United States itself.","If you received a refund in 2018 or 2019 via direct deposit to your bank account, and you did not change your bank account when you moved, you should be able to receive your rebate via direct deposit.

Tax experts said that they think it would be helpful for the IRS to provide guidance for taxpayers who have moved or have new bank accounts since they filed their most recent tax return.

Under the bill, the IRS has to send a notice to a taxpayer’s last known address within 15 days of distributing a payment. The notice should provide information about the payment amount, the method used to make the payment and an IRS phone number to report failures to receive the payment."
The Hill,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/public-global-health/484770-what-to-know-about-the-coronavirus,How deadly is the virus?,"We don’t entirely know yet. Of the 81,191 confirmed cases, 2,768 people have died, a mortality rate of about 3 percent. That would be worse than the Spanish Flu, which had a mortality rate of about 2 percent, and substantially worse than a more ordinary influenza, which kills between one in a thousand and one in ten thousand people.
But there are lots of unknowns.
First, the bad news: Only about 30,000 people have recovered from the virus, which leaves 50,000 or so still in some stage of treatment. Not all of those people will recover, so the mortality rate is expected to rise at least a little bit.
Now, the good news: That 81,191 figure represents only the number of confirmed cases. It appears likely that many thousands more were infected and either did not suffer symptoms or suffered symptoms too minor to seek treatment. In that case, the mortality rate is probably substantially lower than the statistics make it seem.","For a single tax filer, the rebate amount reduces by $5 for every $100 of income over $75,000. So a single person with no children who had adjusted gross income of $85,000 in 2019, and has already filed a 2019 tax return, would receive $700.

Keep in mind that phase-out of the credit is based on people’s adjusted gross income, which does not include income put into pre-tax accounts such as traditional 401(k)s. As a result, someone with an annual salary of $85,000 and no other income could have adjusted gross income of less than $85,000."
The Hill,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/public-global-health/484770-what-to-know-about-the-coronavirus,How sick will the coronavirus make someone?,"That depends on your underlying health. Coronaviruses are not uncommon — you’ve almost certainly had several during your lifetime, and at worst you might have called in sick with a common cold. And even if you contract this particular coronavirus, you may show few if any signs.
But if your health is poor already — especially your respiratory system — this virus is more troubling. Many of those who have succumbed have been older, and young children may be particularly susceptible as well. Those who become ill will have problems in their upper respiratory tract; those who become severely ill will have problems in the lower respiratory tract, and those can lead to really serious health concerns like pneumonia and bronchitis.","At the moment, the federal government is doing a lot of warning. The CDC has produced two dozen guidance documents for hospitals, instructions for preparedness and infection control. Crucially, they are offering guidance on preserving personal protection equipment — like masks and gloves — in a recognition that a widespread outbreak is likely to impact already-low supplies.
The Trump administration has created a task force to oversee the response, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. But the administration has not named a coordinator to oversee a whole-of-government response, similar to what the Obama administration did during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
In other words, there is no one person whose full-time job is to oversee the government’s response.

His administration has requested $2.5 billion in emergency funding, but even Republicans have been skeptical that that’s enough to handle a widespread outbreak. Senate Democrats on Wednesday said they would seek $8.5 billion in funding.
On a state level, hospitals and public health officials are preparing for a growing number of cases. State health directors happen to be in Washington this week for an annual meeting, and many spent Wednesday walking the halls of Congress, lobbying their members to support funding.
At home, those officials are working to make sure their hospitals have the capacity they need to handle an outbreak — enough beds, enough equipment and protective gear, enough laboratory capacity to test samples they take from potentially infected victims, and enough people to run the tests.
“We’re starting to work with hospitals and EMS systems initially to make sure that they have all the capacity that they need,” Shah said of Maine’s preparations. “The public should appreciate that hospitals are used to taking care of sick people. That is what they do.”
What are the broader risks, beyond the virus?
We’ve already seen the virus’s impact in China, where factories and stores closed for days or weeks and cities have been quarantined to stop its spread. Other countries may follow China’s lead. Frieden said the outbreak is likely to cost at least $100 billion to combat globally — and maybe ten times as much, if things spiral out of control.
But as in other outbreaks, the fallout is going to extend beyond immediate health concerns. When Ebola broke out in West Africa, more people died from other, treatable diseases — malaria, cholera, even HIV — because the health systems shut down.
In this case, China is a major source of the generic drugs used in the United States, for everything from hypertension to diabetes. The virus is likely to impact supply chains, making scarce drugs that are completely unrelated to the coronavirus. Experts recommend keeping a three-month supply of any prescription drugs you take on hand in case of that disruption.
“The Chinese manufacturing issue will affect us,” says Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Preparedness at the University of Minnesota. “We’ll have a major shortfall between what will be needed and what will be available.”
Personal protective equipment, like masks and gloves, are already in short supply after a particularly bad flu season. Manufacturers are rushing to fill the gaps, but that takes time, and global demand is growing.
The Department of Health and Human Services said it has a stockpile of about 30 million masks, but says it needs 300 million to protect front-line health care workers. Those workers, who treat patients, would be most at risk of contracting the virus; more than 3,000 health care workers have been infected in China already.
The broader economic impact is also unknown, though Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said in a note to investors Wednesday that the odds of a recession in the first half of the year now stand at 40 percent, twice what he predicted a few months ago.
“If it is a pandemic, if it does show up in Europe and the United States, then that is the prescription for a global and U.S. recession,” he said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are both off more than 6 percent in the last two days, the worst two-day drop in years.
There is a decent chance that major sporting events and public gatherings will be delayed or canceled. A major trade show, the Mobile World Congress, has already been canceled in Barcelona, Spain. Soccer games have been canceled in Italy, and political demonstrations are temporarily banned in Seoul, South Korea.
The organizers of the Tokyo Olympics, set for later this year, have insisted the games will go on. But a former top International Olympic Committee official, Dick Pound, cast doubt on those plans on Tuesday, saying the organizers had about a three-month window in which to decide to pull the plug.
The last time the Olympics were canceled was in 1944, when games scheduled for Italy and London were scrapped because of World War II."

“There’s still a lot we don’t know about this infection. We don’t know how readily it spreads, we don’t know, really, what proportion of people get severely ill,” he told The Hill.
But what we do know is that the virus spreads from person to person through air droplets, much like an influenza. That makes it dissimilar from something more deadly, like Ebola, which spreads only when someone comes into contact with another person’s bodily fluids. There are signs, too, that the coronavirus can transmit even before someone shows symptoms, which is going to cause problems for health officials trying to contain its spread.
Now is a good opportunity to remind ourselves the lessons we teach toddlers: Wash your hands a lot. Cough or sneeze into your elbow. Stay at home if you’re sick. Those little steps end up having big, positive consequences.
Anyone who comes into contact with someone infected with the virus should notify their health care provider, the CDC says. Older people and young children, especially those with underlying health concerns, are at the most risk.","Coronaviruses are a relatively broad family of viruses named for the spikes that come out of a virus particle.

But until a treatment is developed, someone with a severe case of the virus will be treated with supportive care — in extreme cases, with intubation tubes and breathing machines.

Some in the Trump administration have promised a vaccine within the space of a few months, but that’s extremely unlikely.

If you hear a rumor about the virus, check it out with reputable sources — the CDC, state health agencies and the WHO all have websites with the most up-to-date information about the virus and its spread.
Increasingly, those agencies also have fact-checking sections on their websites, aimed at combating misinformation. One of the most troubling rumors that often spreads alongside outbreaks is who exactly has the disease — something that can lead to racial and ethnic profiling.
Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said it is important to separate the disease from the person suffering from the disease. No ethnic group is more or less susceptible to the coronavirus.
“My concern is that fear and misinformation will spread much faster than this virus will,” Shah said in an interview Wednesday.
Bottom line: If you hear what sounds like unrealistic information, check it out before you pass it around social media.","The coronavirus relief bill is not yet law, and the IRS has yet to provide information about how it plans to implement the provision about the rebates.

 1: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

 2: Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

 3: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

 4: Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

 5: Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

 6: Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places - especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.","Can I go out in my vehicle to pick up someone who is stranded somewhere?

3: Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.

4: Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).

5: Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).

6: Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.

7: Pull down the mask's bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.

8: After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.

A majority of the states have issued guidelines until March 31, however, there are some instances where advisories have been issued for shut down of services till mid-April.","You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

 1: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

 2: Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

 3: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

 4: Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

 5: Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

 6: Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places - especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas."

Most spread is from droplets produced when an infected person coughs, which are inhaled by people nearby. Transmission from touching contaminated surfaces hasn't been shown yet, though recent tests by US scientists suggest it's possible -- one reason they recommend washing your hands and not touching your face. The virus can live in the air for several hours, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Cleaning surfaces with solutions containing diluted bleach should kill it. ""While we are still learning about the biology of this virus, it does not appear that there is a major risk of spread through sweat,"" said Julie Fischer, a Georgetown University microbiologist. The biggest concern about going to the gym is infected people coughing on others, or contaminating shared surfaces or equipment, she said. Consider avoiding large classes and peak hours and don't go if you're coughing or feverish, she suggests. The risk of virus transmission from food servers is the same risk as transmission from other infected people, but ""one of the concerns in that food servers, like others facing stark choices about insurance and paychecks, may be pressured to work even if they are sick,"" she said.","Will petrol pumps work?

It's not known. A few reports from China say some people had COVID-19, recovered and then fell ill again. It's unclear if that's a relapse, a new infection, or a case where the person never fully recovered in the first place. Scientists at the at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. It's not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection. Fauci told Congress on Thursday that it was unlikely that someone could get reinfected. ""We haven't formally proved it, but it is strongly likely that that's the case,"" he said. ""Because if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you won't get reinfected.""","It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses.

Meanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.

However, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks.

It's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC.

Meanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.

","Of the more than 586,000 people who have been infected worldwide, more than 26,000 have died. That's a death rate of about 4.6%. The WHO has previously estimated the rate at about 3.4%.

The death rate, however, varies widely based on age, health and geographic location. People who are older or who have preexisting conditions are at higher risk of severe illness.","""It’s not the main mode of transmission. There's probably some component ofairborne, but I don’t think secondhand smoke would be a compounding factor,""said Tania Elliott, clinical instructor of infectious diseases at NYU Langone.If the smoke irritates your lungs and causes you to cough, that poses agreater risk of transmission since the virus is thought to mainly spreadthrough respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes, Elliot said.Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smokingmeans that fingers and possibly dirty cigarettes are in contact with lips,[according to the WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-smoking-and-covid-19). Smokers may also already have lung disease or reducedlung capacity which would greatly increase risk of serious illness, the WHOsays.While data is still evolving about how long the virus may remain alive, [arecent study](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/18/heres-how-long-coronavirus-can-live-surfaces-and-air-study/2863287001/) found thatviable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air."
USA Today,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/12/coronavirus-reader-questions-answered-symptoms-testing-elderly/5012457002/,Can someone get the coronavirus more than once?,"Scientists aren't sure yet. For many viruses, including the MERS virus, patients are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover because a protective antibody is generated in those who are infected. But scientists still need to do more research to determine if this is also the case with COVID-19 and how long those antibodies may last.

""However, in certain individuals, the antibody cannot last that long. For many patients who have been cured, there is a likelihood of relapse,"" said Li QinGyuan, director of pneumonia prevention and treatment at China Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing.

Poland agreed, saying the chance of reinfection is ""very likely.""","No, the presence of the coronavirus would not turn a flu test positive.However, it's possible to have both the coronavirus and the flu at the sametime. In that case, the flu test would be positive.The opposite is also true: Presence of the flu would not result in a positivecoronavirus test. It's important to note that, even if someone tests negativefor the coronavirus, they still may be infected with the coronavirus."
USA Today,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/12/coronavirus-reader-questions-answered-symptoms-testing-elderly/5012457002/,Are infected people able to transmit the virus to their pets and visa versa?,"No, there is no evidence that pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the WHO.

Last month, the pet dog of a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong tested ""weak"" positive for COVID-19 and was put in quarantine. Scientists concluded that pet cats and dogs can test positive for low levels of the pathogen if they catch it from their owners, but pets can't get sick from the virus.","Yes, a person could have both. This was the case for one patient in China, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 69-year-old man in Wuhan had both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Doctors initially diagnosed the man with the flu and later diagnosed the coronavirus.

Doctors studying the patient said the case ""suggests that COVID-19 might be underdiagnosed because of false-negative tests for upper respiratory specimens or co-infection with other respiratory viruses. Broader viral testing might be needed.""

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, agrees.

""I don’t like that people are doing flu tests and saying therefore it’s not coronavirus,"" Hotez said. ""Traditionally, for flu, we know it’s possible to get other co-infectious with other viruses."""

A recent study by scientists in the U.S. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. 

However, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. The CDC found traces of the virus' RNA, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship – 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.

It's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC. But scientists don't think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads; the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person's cough or sneeze, the CDC reports.

Meanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.

At the same time, the WHO is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible. Viruses can survive on hard surfaces like coins for days in some cases. U.S dollars, a blend of fabric and paper, are harder for viruses to stick to.","If you have symptoms and want to get tested, the CDC recommends calling your state or local health department or a medical provider.

Just 2%–3% of cases in that age group had to be hospitalized, and none were in the ICU.

This week, however, health officials reported that a 17-year-old teen in New Orleans died after contracting the virus. And a 2-month-old in Nashville who tested positive for the virus could be the youngest patient in the nation, officials say.

Some people also develop aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.

While fever is one of the most common symptoms, it's not productive to take your temperature every day, Poland said.

""That's like taking your blood pressure four times a day for no particular good reason. I’d probably not do that unless there's a reason to do it.
